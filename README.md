# PH 107 Resources

These mainly comprise of the answers I wrote for the in-video Quizzes that were a part of our PH 107 course.

Hopefully, they will be of use to you!

The book I found most useful for this course was "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics" by David J Griffiths and
Darryl F Schroeter. Note that the chapter on Quantum Statistical Mechanics (which is a part of this course) 
is present only in the second edition of this book.
